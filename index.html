<h1>Before exploring the modeling scenarios</h1>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>What is the point of studying modelling scenarios reliability
?</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>In the case where the modelling scenarios underestimate the evolution
of the epidemic (A), the risk is not to react, or not enough.
Conversely, if the scenarios overestimate the evolution of the epidemic
(B), the risk is to overreact and in particular to take too many
measures with deleterious effects without being justified. Indeed, most
of the measures taken to curb the epidemic (lockdown, curfew, school
closure, closure of public places) have negative health, social and
economic impacts. Therefore, overreacting to the epidemic is not a good
thing (nor is under-reacting).</p>

<p><img src="images/explication_simulation_enjeu.PNG" width="800" /></p>
</center>
<p>A more detailed explanation is available on the <a
href="impact.html">Impact page</a>.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Isn’t the point of modeling to prevent worst-case scenarios
from happening ?</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>An common argument about modelling scenarios is that since the
scenario anticipates the worst, it leads to measures being taken that
will prevent the modelled scenario from occurring, which explains the
discrepancy between the modelled scenario and reality (where measures
have been taken!). Indeed, it is not possible to establish a comparison
in this case.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="images/pas_de_comparaison.PNG" width="500" /></p>
</center>
<p>However, modeling scenarios often incorporate several assumptions
about the measures that could be implemented. Here, we will only compare
reality with scenarios where the implemented measures were also
modeled.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="images/comparaison_explication.PNG" width="500" /></p>
</center>
<p>Thus, the comparison between modeling scenarios and reality will make
it possible to evaluate whether they have correctly anticipated
reality.</p>

<h2>1. March 2020, the model that led the world towards lockdown</h2>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>By March 2020, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the impact
that covid-19 would have. When Italy began to be heavily affected in
mid-March, many European countries realized that covid-19 was likely to
have significant consequences. To anticipate the evolution of the
pandemic, policy-makers turned to the field of epidemiological
modelling.</p>
<p>A team of scientists from Imperial College (London), led by Professor
Neil Ferguson, published on March 16 the <a
href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/">report</a>
that led many European governments, including the <a
href="https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/03/15/coronavirus-les-simulations-alarmantes-des-epidemiologistes-pour-la-france_6033149_3244.html">French
government</a>, to implement lockdowns. The scenarios presented in the
report anticipated, without any measures, about 500,000 deaths in less
than 3 months in the UK, and similar figures for France. Implementing
standard measures such as planned in pandemic preparedness (mitigation
strategy) plans would yield 250 000 deaths. The report argued that only
the implementation of stricter measures to suppress the virus (such as
lockdown) would allow the wave to be contained and that it would be the
only way to avoid saturating the hospital system. Relying on this
report, many governments have chosen to implement lockdown-style
strategies.</p>
<p>Of course, projections of what would happen in the absence of
measures cannot be compared with what actually happened in a country
that implemented a lockdown. This is one of the most common
counter-arguments to the critics of epidemiological models: it is
precisely because of the measures that the modelling scenarios did not
come true.</p>
<p>But there is one country that allows us to test the validity of the
modeling scenarios: Sweden. In the first wave, Sweden chose not to
confine itself, preferring to rely on lighter measures. It is therefore
possible to compare what the scenarios for Sweden predicted and what
actually happened.</p>

12</a>, published on March 26, contains models of the epidemic in all
countries, including Sweden.</p>
<p>The first 2 graphs represent the peak occupancy of ICU and hospital
beds. The gray bars represent the Imperial College scenarios: early
strict lockdown, late strict lockdown, and no action. The red bar
represents the reality. Since Sweden has implemented social distancing
measures without imposing lockdown, the observed numbers should have
been somewhere between the “lockdown” and “no restrictions” scenarios.
The reality is quite different. Even though Sweden did NOT implement
lockdown, the scenarios WITH lockdown overestimate the peak of used beds
by a factor 2 to 10. A scenario with some restrictions should be between
lockdown and no restrictions scenarios, yielding a overestimation by a
factor 10 to 60.</p>
<p>The last graph shows the different Imperial College scenarios for
mortality in grey, and the actual number of deaths in red. Here again,
the scenarios greatly overestimate mortality. The actual number of
deaths corresponds to the early lockdown scenario, which was obviously
not the approach taken by Sweden. The intermediate scenarios of social
distancing overestimate mortality by a factor 3 to 7.</p>

<p><strong>Political and media impact</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>These models were one of the main triggers for the French national
lockdown (which will influence other European countries to follow the
same path). In its <a
href="https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/avis_conseil_scientifique_12_mars_2020.pdf">report
of March 12, 2020</a>, the Scientific Council asserted that the
classical measures used to limit the spread of epidemics would not allow
to sufficiently limit the circulation of the virus, implying the
necessity of a strict confinement. This assertion was based on the
Imperial College modelling :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not expected that the reduction in the size of the epidemic
peak will be sufficient to avoid saturation of the health system. (…)
This intuition was illustrated through the realization of a particular
COVID19 model (Neil Ferguson, personal communication)</p>
<p>Extract from the report of the Scientific Council of March 12,
2020</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the figure above shows that these models vastly overestimated
what would happen with conventional disease control measures, this claim
is likely to be challenged.</p>
<p>The political influence of these models continues long after March
2020. When in July 2021 the Spanish Constitutional Court declared the
first lockdown unconstitutional, <a
href="https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/presidente/news/Paginas/2020/20200610control-session.aspx">the
Minister of Justice countered by assuring that it had saved 450,000
lives in Spain</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is not me talking, but established by independent scientific
studies - as a result of this lockdown, 450,000 lives have been saved.
We have lost the lives of more than 27,000 fellow countrymen, but we
have saved the lives of 450,000 people</p>
<p>President of the Government of Spain, Pedro Sánchez</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the source of this figure is not specified, it does correspond
to the pessimistic scenario of the <a
href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/Imperial-College-COVID19-Global-unmitigated-mitigated-suppression-scenarios.xlsx">appendix</a>
of the <a
href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-12-global-impact-covid-19/">report
12</a> of Imperial College applied to Spain. The case of Sweden
questions this statement. Indeed, had the Swedish government locked down
its population, it could have claimed, like the Spanish minister, that
its action saved 90,000 people. We know that this is not the case, as
the real death toll without lockdownd was 5,000, or 18 times less.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Discussion of scenario assumptions (technical)</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>For fatalities, Imperial College has developed 4 scenarios:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>No action</li>
<li>Mitigation: social distancing of the population in a uniform way
(40% reduction of contacts)</li>
<li>Mitigation: same as 2. but with increased social distancing of the
over 70s (60% reduction in contacts for this category)</li>
<li>Suppression of transmissions (lockdown): expanded and intense social
distancing (75% reduction in contact for the entire population).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is impossible to measure the actual reduction in contact, but
mobility data can provide an approximation. In Sweden, the use of
workplaces, train stations, and shopping and leisure facilities was
reduced by a maximum of 30-45%, and food stores and pharmacies by
10-15%. This seems to confirm that Sweden was not leaning towards
scenario 4, but rather towards a slight mitigation. For comparison, in
France, the use of workplaces, shops and leisure facilities was reduced
by 70-90% and food stores by 50%, which is in line with scenario 4 of
lockdown.</p>

<p><img src="images/Imperial_Sweden/France_mobility.png"
width="500" /></p>
</center>
<p>Although not corresponding to reality, we have chosen to represent
the “no action” scenarios for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the case of intensive care units and hospital peaks, no
intermediate scenario was produced, only the “lockdown” and “no
restrictions” scenarios. Presenting these 2 scenarios allows to imagine
where the reality should have been, somewhere between the two.</p></li>
<li><p>Although unrealistic, the “no action” projections are often put
forward as a counterfactual to the absence of lockdown, as illustrated
by the case of the hospital peak mentioned above. This is also the case
in the press (figure of <a
href="https://www.bfmtv.com/international/coronavirus-en-angleterre-les-projections-effrayantes-du-nombre-de-morts-en-cas-de-laisser-faire_AN-202003180090.html">500,000
deaths in the UK</a>) or by politicians (figure of <a
href="https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/forme-espagne-un-confinement-juge-inconstitutionnel-des-milliers-damendes-remboursees">450,000
people saved</a> according to the Spanish Minister of Justice). This <a

by BFM</a> even states that a mitigation strategy is a “laissez-faire”
strategy :</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>By “laissez-faire,” researchers mean so-called mitigation measures,
such as quarantining identified Covid-19 cases and their relatives and
closing schools</p>

<p><strong>Impact politique et médiatique</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>Although the report that led to these models has not, to our
knowledge, been made public, they have nevertheless been communicated to
the press and the government, as reported in the article in Les
Echos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is perhaps the modelling carried out by the Pasteur Institute for
the ARS Ile-de-France and the AP-HP - by Professor Simon Cauchemez -
that invites the government to be cautious. Dated Tuesday and for
internal use, they show that the number of patients in intensive care
will remain high for a long time, at least until the summer. And that
whatever the scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The confidentiality of the report from which these curves were taken
raises the question of the transparency of the models. Similarly, the <a

<p><strong>Political and media impact</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>The modelling of October 26 was one of the triggers for the 2nd
lockdown. Notably, <a
href="https://www.vie-publique.fr/discours/276951-emmanuel-macron-28102020-covid-19">during
his October 28 speech</a>, Emmanuel Macron announced that the number of
patients in intensive care would exceed 9000 “whatever we do”. The
actual peak will be half that number, at about 4800 critical care beds.
It can be seen that in order to justify a political decision, only the
most pessimistic model was put forward by the executive. It was also
presented as a certainty, even though it was only one scenario among
others.</p>
<p>These models were also widely reported in the press: <a
href="https://www.tf1info.fr/sante/video-deuxieme-vague-les-scenarios-qui-inquietent-2168899.html">“Second
wave: worrying scenarios”</a> was the headline on LCI after the
announcement of the second lockdown, presenting scenarios with ICU peak
levels of 5,500, 6,200 and 9,000 patients.</p>

<summary>
<p><strong>Discussion of scenario assumptions (technical)</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>As the report has not been made public, it has not been possible for
us to explore the assumptions of the scenarios in details. According to
the elements reported by Les Echos, the different scenarios correspond
to different values of reproduction rate “R” from 0.7 to 1.2, reflecting
a more or less marked efficiency of the lockdown.</p>

<h2>4. Winter 2021, extended curfew</h2>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>During the winter 2020-2021 marked by an extended curfew, a
deterioration of the health situation led Inserm and the Pasteur
Institute to publish modelling scenarios from mid-January to
mid-February. These scenarios were used as a basis to consider the
implementation of a strict lockdown in early February, which did not
take place in the end, offering the possibility to compare the
projections with what actually happened.</p>
<p>The first regional lockdowns were implemented on March 20, followed
later by others until the national lockdown on April 3. The latency
between the implementation of measures and their effect on
hospitalizations being at least one week, and even 2 to 3 weeks as
indicated by the <a
href="https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/avis_conseil_scientifique_12_mars_2020.pdf">scientific
council report</a> (“the first effects of the measures adopted […] can
only appear after two to three weeks”), we stop our graph at March 27.
Beyond that point, it is no longer legitimate to compare the dynamics of
the pandemic to the “no lockdown” scenarios.</p>
<p>Before these dates, a number of measures unlikely to impact the
national dynamics of the epidemic were taken: on 25 February weekend
lockdown in Dunkerque and part of the Alpes-Maritimes, and on 4 March
weekend lockdown in Pas-de-Calais, as well as closed shopping centers of
more than 10,000 m2.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Comparison of scenarios to real data: Inserm
scenarios</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>The 1-month scenarios all point to an exponential increase in
hospital admissions. The reality will be a slight decrease followed by
an increase back to about the initial level. Almost all scenarios exceed
30,000 weekly admissions by mid-March with no sign of slowing down the
dynamics, while the reality was around 10,000, i.e. 3 times less. The
most optimistic scenario overestimates hospitalizations by a factor of
50-100%.</p>

campaign is likely to be intermediate between the scenarios with and
without vaccination”, hence our choice to represent these 2 curves.
Later in the report, two other secondary variations are presented to
illustrate the influence of a small variation in the reproduction rate:
these are the curves stopping in March. We stopped their curves here

<p>The INSERM report of January 16 deserves clarification, because it
says that the effect of the early curfew at 6 pm is not taken into
account, but that the most optimistic scenario could reflect the
measure. Should we have kept only this one and excluded the other
scenarios? Our decision to keep them all was based on several
points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, the authors made the choice to represent them, indicating
that they themselves validated the relevance of these scenarios. Indeed,
they do not hesitate to state that “new hospitalizations should reach
about 25,000 between mid-February and early April in the absence of
intervention”.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on these results, they did not hesitate to give explicit
policy recommendations “These results show the need to strengthen social
distancing measures” and this even though the curfew, whose very purpose
is to avoid more restrictive measures, was not modeled…</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we see that the scenarios of January 16 are very similar
to those of February 2, even though these “effectively integrate all the
social distancing measures”, indicating that taking into account the
curfew does not change much</p></li>

<p>These models supported the <a

Council report of May 6, 2021</a>. Although the Scientific Council
specifies that “These projections […] are not predictions”, it relies on
them to estimate that “under plausible assumptions, a significant
rebound of the epidemic is possible during the summer period if control
measures are relaxed too quickly, even when considering a significant
rate of vaccination. This is one of the arguments that pushed the
Scientific Council to position itself in favor of a”prudent and
controlled” reopening of social activities following the 3rd

<p><strong>Discussion of scenario assumptions (technical)</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>For the April 26 report, the curves are taken from Figures 3b and 3d.
The assumptions made in the scenarios are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A 60% or 40% more transmissible alpha variant compared to the
original strain</p></li>
<li><p>More or less rapid lifts of the measures, resulting in recovery
reproduction rates R from 1 to 1.3, starting May 15. We excluded the
most pessimistic scenario (R = 1.3) which corresponded to an almost
total lifting of the measures from mid-May, which was not the
case.</p></li>
<li><p>Median or pessimistic assumptions regarding the reduction of
hospitalizations</p></li>
<li><p>A vaccine distribution rate of 350,000 or 500,000 doses per day.
We only kept the 500,000 doses/day scenarios, which are close to reality
for May, as shown in the graph below.</p></li>
</ul>
<center>
<p><img src="images/Pasteur_2021_Avril/vaccine_doses_april.png"
width="500" /></p>
</center>
<p>For the May 21 report, we did not need to check the hypotheses, as
Simon Cauchemez himself had compared the epidemic trajectory to his
scenarios, and the significant differences only occur after
mid-June.</p>
<p>In both cases we stop the comparison in mid-June, when the appearance
of the delta variant not predicted by the models renders the hypotheses
null and void.</p>

context of the delta variant spread. Two out of three scenarios
presented anticipated a number of critical care beds by the end of
August at least equal to the 2nd wave, and in the absence of measures a
peak in September well above the 1st wave.</p>
<p>Faced with the prospect of hospital flooding suggested by these
scenarios, the extended sanitary pass was implemented on 21 July,
leading to a sharp increase in vaccinations and rendering the hypotheses

<p>The model clearly shows that by the end of August, we will find

<p>This presentation of the Institut Pasteur’s projections to the Senate

and may therefore have played a role in the senators’ opinion.</p>
<p>The Institut Pasteur’s modelling was also <a

requests, the Conseil d’Etat explained in particular that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data “could be even more worrisome in early August, according to
Pasteur Institute’s modelling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the United Kingdom faced the same situation in July:
an increase in hospitalizations, accompanied by scenarios suggesting
hospital overwhelm. Unlike France, the UK did not implement a sanitary

<p>The scenarios from the first report are taken from Figures 4, 5 and
6. Scenarios with assumptions that did not match reality were excluded
from the comparison, reducing the number of scenarios from 108 to only 6
for admissions and 12 for the number of occupied beds. Details of
assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Time spent in critical care units for patients: 14.6 days or 10
days</p></li>
<li><p>R reduction to 1.5, 1.8 or 2 due to social distancing and
sanitary pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccine adherence of &gt;60 years: 90 or 95%. We have retained
only the 90% scenarios, in line with the graph below.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccination adherence of 18-59 year olds: 70% or 90%. We have
only retained the 90% scenarios, in line with the graph below.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccine adherence of 12-17 year olds: 30%, 50% 70%. We did not
need to test this assumption, because for high adult vaccination
coverage (90%), vaccination of adolescents has no impact on the hospital
trajectory according to the report’s own results.</p></li>
<li><p>Vaccine doses distributed per day: 500,000, 700,000, or 800,000.
We have eliminated the 800,000 doses/day scenarios, which are too far
from reality (see graph below). The 700,000 scenario may only correspond
to the first week of August, but we chose to also keep it alog with the
600,000 scenario..</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second report only makes assumptions about the time spent in
critical care (10, 14 or 17 days) and the number of doses of vaccine
distributed per day (600,000, 700,000, 800,000). Given the figures
below, we have excluded the 700,000 and 800,000 doses/day scenarios.</p>

<p>Most scenarios are at the level of a contained epidemic circulation,

in June-July”, coupled with an unfavorable climate modulation. Although
the control measures were not relaxed to the June-July level, when there
was no sanitary pass, it is impossible for us to measure the “relaxation
of behaviors”, so we kept these scenarios.</p>

<h2>9. December 2021, second delta wave</h2>

<p><strong>Contexte</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>In the context of a second delta wave, Pasteur Institute produced 2
reports on <a
href="https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/scenarios/Institut_Pasteur_diminution_de_limmunit%C3%A9_et_rappel_20211129.pdf">November
29</a> and <a

2, 2021</a> with scenarios covering winter and spring 2022.
Unfortunately, the emergence of the omicron variant 2 weeks later
renders the hypotheses obsolete and does not allow a comparison with
reality.</p>
<p>A criticism often made of the comparison of real data to “scenarios”
as performed above is that the latter are not “predictions”, and simply
serve to give an idea of the major trends and impact of different
measures.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, beyond the scenarios presented in its reports, the
Institut Pasteur also publishes “Short-term projections of hospital
needs” on <a
href="https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/realtime-analysis/hospital/">this
page</a> , which are regularly updated. Here, the goal is indeed to
correctly forecast the number of patients, the Institute stating that
“the relative error for projections of the number of critical care beds
at the national level is 11% at 14 days.”</p>
<p>Here we compare the model projection 2 weeks before the peak of the
second delta wave in mid-December 2021. This peak occurred just before
the emergence of the omicron variant, which changed the game in the
weeks that followed.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Comparison of scenarios to actual data</strong>.</p>
</summary>
<p>At the time of the peak of the delta variant, the model projection
corresponds to an overestimation 2 weeks later of 30% for critical care
beds, and of about 40% for the other indicators.</p>
<p>Despite an average model accuracy of 10%, at the time of the peak the
actual error will have been much higher. We would have liked to compare
the model projections to the other peaks (February 2021, April 2021,
August 2021) in order to assess whether this was a one-time error or a
systematic bias on the peaks. Such an evaluation is important because it
is the anticipation of a hospital peak that conditions most of the
policy response.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the regular updating of projections on the <a
href="https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/realtime-analysis/hospital/">page
presenting the results</a> overwrites previously published projections,
and we were unable to make this systematic assessment. Keeping previous
results in open data would help such an approach and an appropriation of
the results by citizens.</p>

href="https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/avis_conseil_scientifique_12_mars_2020.pdf">Scientific
Council Report</a> states, “the first effects of the measures adopted
[…] can only appear after two to three weeks”.</p>

<h2>10. January 2022, Omicron variant</h2>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>Following the appearance of the Omicron variant, the Pasteur
Institute published a <a
href="https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/variant/Institut_Pasteur_Impact_dOmicron_sur_lepidemie_francaise_20211227.pdf">first
report on December 27, 2021</a>, presenting more than a hundred
scenarios. Indeed, it is specified that “given the uncertainties […], it
is not possible to quantify precisely the impact that the Omicron wave
will have”. Therefore, we did not analyze this report.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/variant/InstitutPasteur_Complement_Analyse_Impact_Omicron_20220107_corrige.pdf">following
report of January 7</a> takes as a basis the previous one in the light
of the new data, and excludes the scenarios that do not fit the Omicron
properties, making it possible to analyze the results.</p>
<p>We also analyze a <a
href="https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/variant/Institut_Pasteur_Comparaison_Observations_projections_Omicron_20220215.pdf">report
published on February 15</a>, which is a self-assessment comparing what
was “predicted” (the term used by the report) with what actually
happened.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<p><strong>Comparison of scenarios to actual data</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>The report distinguished “likely” scenarios (first ones presented) to
“less likely” scenarios (below). It also distinguished between vaccine
booster dose efficacy of 85% or 60% (for the first 6 months).</p>
<p>The reality is an initial vaccine efficacy of about 50% and then 0%
after 3 months (see paragraph “Institut Pasteur’s self-evaluation”).
Thus, we should have excluded at least the 85% scenario, and kept the
60% scenario. However, since the Institut Pasteur only reports the 85%
scenario in its self-assessmen to affirm that “the predicted and
observed dynamics of daily admissions are close”, we have chosen to also
represent it.</p>

<p><strong>Political and media impact</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>The Pasteur Institute self-evaluation was forwarded to the Senators
as part of their inquiry about <a
href="https://www.senat.fr/rap/r21-537/r21-5371.pdf">the adequacy of the
vaccine pass to the evolution of the covid-19 epidemic</a>. It is stated
that “the projections of the Pasteur Institute have turned out to be
within the anticipated ranges”. We detail in the following section the
reasons why we think this statement is seriously challenged. Moreover,
there is no mention of other past scenarios when the Pasteur Institute
was completely wrong, for instance in <a
href="https://evaluation-modelisation-covid.github.io/france_eng/index.html#august-2021-4th-wave-and-delta-variant">August
2021 with the sanitary pass</a></p>
<p><img src="images/Pasteur_2022_Fevrier/senate_pasteur.png"
width="500" /></p>
<p>The Pasteur Institut’s self-evaluation report was also quoted in <a
href="https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/entry/institut-pasteur-avait-vu-juste-pour-la-5e-vague-voici-ses-predictions-sur-la-fin-de-lhiver_fr_620d0102e4b05706db70a281">some
press articles</a> as saying that “Institut Pasteur was right about
almost everything on the impact of Omicron”.</p>

<p><strong>Institut Pasteur self-assessment and discussion of
hypotheses</strong></p>
</summary>
<p>Several points raise questions in the self-evaluation conducted by
the Institut Pasteur presented below. We note in passing that our own
retrospective is consistent with the figure presented by the
Institute.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="images/Pasteur_2022_Fevrier/auto_eval_pasteur.png"
width="400" /></p>
</center>
<p>The most obvious one is the total absence of any reference to vaccine
efficacy and the choice to represent only the curves illustrating a
vaccine efficacy of 85%, contrary to our graphs. However, an <a
href="https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/communique-de-presse/au-dela-de-trois-mois-la-dose-de-rappel-ne-semble-plus-proteger-contre-les">official
note from DREES</a> explicitly states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Beyond three months, the booster dose no longer seems to protect
against Covid-19 infections”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of publication of the report, the <a
href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1052353/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_5.pdf">British
surveillance data</a> already indicated a vaccine efficacy of only 50%
after 10 weeks, far from 85%. <a
href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1083443/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-24.pdf">Their
more recent data</a> (below) confirm an initial efficacy of 45% and then
almost zero after 3 months.</p>
<center>
<p><img src="images/Pasteur_2022_Fevrier/UK_vaccine_consensus.png"
width="500" /></p>
</center>
<p>Even journalists correctly identified as early as January 13 that a
85% protection against infections is a <a
href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/la-vaccination-avec-rappel-reduit-elle-les-infections-de-85-face-a-omicron-comme-laffirme-olivier-veran-20220113_VF5GJUFTRVCV5J3RANQGJOQMKY/">“largely
incorrect figure”</a>.Could Pasteur’s team have been unaware of these
elements at the time of their self-evaluation?</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike us, the self-evaluation does not present the “less
likely” scenarios. This raises the question of good practice in
retrospective evaluation, to be defined upstream. Would the team have
discarded these scenarios if reality had followed them?</p>
<p>We note that while the team regularly insists that <a
href="https://www.liberation.fr/sciences/2020/11/03/simon-cauchemez-le-pic-de-cette-vague-en-reanimation-devrait-arriver-mi-novembre_1804291/">“the
scenarios are not predictions”</a>, the self-assessment is less
cautious, with the term “predicted” recurring several times in the
report, e.g., “the predicted and observed dynamics of daily admissions
are also close.”</p>
<p>We remind that testing the adequacy of assumptions is important,
because as the beginning of each of the Institut Pasteur reports reminds
us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trajectories described depend on the assumptions made; if the
assumptions are not realized, the observed dynamics may differ from the
projections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the Pasteur Institute did not apply its own statement to itself
concerning its vaccine efficacy assumption.</p>
