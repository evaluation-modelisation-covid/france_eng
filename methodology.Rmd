# Our Protocol

The curves presented on the site are derived from modelling scenarios that have impacted public policies implemented in France. They were mainly produced by the Pasteur Institute and Inserm. As the data are not available in free access, we have extracted them from the report curves using [WebPlotDigitilizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/).

To allow for a proper evaluation of the modelling scenarios, only those scenarios with verified assumptions were retained, including the hypotheses regarding the restrictive measures implemented. In order not to introduce bias (e.g., taking only those scenarios that overestimated reality, or the opposite), we studied all the reports. We analysed:

1. all the models from the Pasteur Institute reports, published on their [web page](https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/)
2. the models quoted in the [Scientific Council reports](https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/actualites/presse/dossiers-de-presse/article/conseil-scientifique-covid-19), which led us to identify Inserm scenarios for January-February 2021
3. the [Imperial College modelling for the 1st lockdown](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-12-global-impact-covid-19/), cited by the Scientific Council which had a major impact on French public policies
4. a retrospective google search with delimited dates for each month and the keywords "INSERM", "Pasteur", "modeling", "scenario". This allowed to identify scenarios not officially published but nevertheless cited by the press: [Pasteur Institute for the 2nd lockdown](https://www.lesechos.fr/economie-france/social/covid-la-decrue-dans-les-services-de-reanimation-esperee-en-france-dans-une-dizaine-de-jours-1261656)of November 2020, and Pasteur Institute for the [lockdown exit of the Ile-de-France in May 2020.](https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/editos-analyses/pourquoi-philippe-a-douche-les-francais-1199309)

Finally, we focus on hospital indicators, and exclude the number of cases from our analysis. We believe that there are two reasons for this exclusion. The first is that the number of cases is a less objective indicator than the number of occupied beds, because it depends in particular on the propensity of the French to be tested, which varies over time. Secondly, the number of cases does not say much about the danger of infections. From January 2022 onwards, the number of cases is 10 times higher than the pre-Omicron figures, without a proportional impact on the hospital.

We were still able to compare short-term projections during the short 2-week window before the Omicron variant distorted the results.
-   [December 2, 2021](https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/scenarios/Institut_Pasteur_Complement_rapport_rappel_20211202.pdf) : excluded (impact of the Omicron variant 2 weeks later, which was not included in the models). We were still able to compare short-term projections during the short 2-week window before the Omicron variant distorted the results.

Indeed, it is specified that "given the uncertainties [...], it is not possible to quantify precisely the impact that the Omicron wave will have". About a hundred scenarios were then produced. The following report of January 7, which we have analyzed, uses this report as a basis, after excluding the scenarios that do not fit the properties of Omicron.

We discuss this in our analysis of the latter report.
-   [February 21, 2022](https://modelisation-covid19.pasteur.fr/variant/Institut_Pasteur_Impact_BA_2_epidemie_francaise_20220221.pdf) : excluded. Focuses only on the number of cases, which is an exclusionary criterion in our methodology as explained above.

-   January-February 2021 models: included because they appear in the [report of the Scientific Council of January 29, 2021](https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/note_eclairage_variants_modelisation_29_janvier_2021.pdf) suggesting the establishment of a strict confinement. They have also been published in the press. These models appeared in the Inserm reports of [January 16, 2021](https://www.epicx-lab.com/uploads/9/6/9/4/9694133/inserm_covid-19-voc_dominance-20210116.pdf), [February 2, 2021](https://www.epicx-lab.com/uploads/9/6/9/4/9694133/inserm-covid-19-voc-lockdown-20210202.pdf) and [February 14, 2021](https://www.epicx-lab.com/uploads/9/6/9/4/9694133/inserm_covid-19-voc_socialdistancing-20210214.pdf).
